      heading: What are "Anonymous" accounts?
      paragraph_1_html: >
        Nobody likes having to create an account before being able to
        check out something cool.
      paragraph_2_html: >
        So you don't need an account. If you're just browsing or deciding
        whether or not it's worth creating an account, you can simply log in
        with the big, blue <a href="/be-anonymous">Be Anonymous</a> button.
      paragraph_3_html: >
        Clicking the button will generate a random account and automatically
        log you in, letting you jump right in to planning your stories.
        Everything acts exactly as it would if you were logged in to a "real"
        account, except with one caveat:
      paragraph_4_html: >
        <strong>If you log out or close your browser without
        <a href="/account">setting a username and password for yourself</a>,
        your account will be deleted.</strong> To keep all of your content,
        all you have to do is visit <a href="/account">this page</a> and type
        in the login information you want to use &ndash; it's that easy. All of
        your content will be saved and you can log in to your account with that
        username in the future.

        <p>Welcome to Indent. Before you get started, it's recommended that you
        %{create_universe_link}.</p>
        <p>This universe will contain
        everything you create about your world, and is a handy way to keep multiple worlds
        cleanly separated during the planning process.</p>
