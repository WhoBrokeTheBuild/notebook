      heading: What are "Anonymous" accounts?
      paragraph_1_html: >
        Nobody likes having to create an account before being able to
        check out something cool.
      paragraph_2_html: >
        So you don't need an account. If you're just browsing or deciding
        whether or not it's worth creating an account, you can simply log in
        with the big, blue <a href="/be-anonymous">Be Anonymous</a> button.
      paragraph_3_html: >
        Clicking the button will generate a random account and automatically
        log you in, letting you jump right in to planning your stories.
        Everything acts exactly as it would if you were logged in to a "real"
        account, except with one caveat:
      paragraph_4_html: >
        <strong>If you log out or close your browser without
        <a href="/account">setting a username and password for yourself</a>,
        your account will be deleted.</strong> To keep all of your content,
        all you have to do is visit <a href="/account">this page</a> and type
        in the login information you want to use &ndash; it's that easy. All of
        your content will be saved and you can log in to your account with that
        username in the future.

        I'm no lawyer, and I won't pretend to be. Nobody likes reading those
        legalese documents, so I'll just give you the facts in English:

        Indent will <strong>always</strong> do its best to maintain the
        security and privacy of your data, in order to ensure that it is you

        locations, etc., with anyone other than you. No advertisers, no

        For those of you who <em>do</em> like legalese documents: I'm sorry I'm
        not a lawyer. I'm working to get one to write something official soon,
        but in the meantime you'll have to take my word for it.
